			The pRSSlist program is a Perl application for creating and maintaining RSS feeds. It is an easy to use open source authoring tool operated with a browser interface that can run locally on a computer running Mac OS X, or Linux, or accessed remotely through a web server. The product is available as Open Source software under the GNU GPLv2 license for no charge. This is a fork of ListGarden<SMALL><SUP>TM</SUP></SMALL> v1.3.1 software from Software Garden Inc.
		</div>

		<h1>Why pRSSlist?</h1>

		<p>I once used the ListGarden<SMALL><SUP>TM</SUP></SMALL> RSS generator but found it wanting in some areas. It was last updated in 2005, and I had thought to update it.</p>
		<p>However, the easiest thing it seemed was to maintain my own copy. pRSSlist was born from a fork of v1.3.1 of ListGardenâ„¢ from <a href="http://softwaregarden.com">Software Garden</a> Inc.</p>
		<p>Github is the perfect social coding platform to host pRSSlist on.</p>

		<h1>Use of pRSSlist</h1>
		<p>The guides here are over on Software Garden's homepage, and they are great starting points for using pRSSlist in it's current form.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.softwaregarden.com/products/listgarden/podcasting.html" title="Software Garden ListGarden Program: Setting Up an RSS Feed for Podcasting Using ListGarden">Setting Up an RSS Feed for Podcasting</a><br />This page gives step-by-step instructions for using prsslist (in its previous incarnation known as ListGarden) to create an RSS feed for a podcast so that listeners can subscribe and automatically download new episodes when they are available. It also shows how to automatically create a companion "List of Shows" HTML page.</p>

		<h2>Dependencies</h2>
		<p>The <strong>system requirements</strong> are: Internet connection if uploading the RSS files by FTP, 200KB+ disk space, Perl language system that includes the library modules:
			<ul>
				<li>LWP::UserAgent</li>
				<li>Net::FTP</li>
				<li>Time::Local.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Install</h2>
		<p>This section tells you how to install and run the Generic Perl Version on Unix, Linux and similar systems.</p>
		<p>See the wiki if you want to run it on a <a href="http://wiki.github.com/lantrix/prsslist/web-server" title="Web Server - prsslist - GitHub">Web Server</a>. If you want you can also read the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/lantrix/prsslist/installation-on-mac-os-x" title="Installation on Mac OS X - prsslist - GitHub">Installation On Mac OS X</a>.</p>

		<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

		<p>The prsslist program is written in the Perl computer language. In order to run, it requires a copy of the Perl language system which is commonly found preinstalled on most Linux and similar systems, as well as on most web servers.</p>

		<h1>USING IT ON YOUR SYSTEM</h1>

		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<p>Follow these instructions to install and run prsslist:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure that you have Perl installed on your system. When you have Perl installed, you can run Perl programs from the command line by executing <code>perl programfile</code> or if you are running a web server, by serving a Perl program whose permission is set to <em>Execute</em>. You can check that Perl is installed and see the version information by executing the command <code>perl -v</code>.</li>
			<li>Read the <a href="#license">License</a> Agreement to make sure that you understand the restrictions and rights that apply to this program. The source code is covered by the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt" title="">GNU GPLv2</a>. The Generic Perl Version is available for free and comes with no warranty of any kind.</li>
			<li>If you do not agree to the above license, do not download or use the program.* You may not use or copy the program except under terms of the license.</li>
			<li>Download the Local Generic Perl Version from the "Downloads page":http://github.com/lantrix/prsslist/downloads, or use git to clone the latest version by following these steps
				<pre>
					git clone git://github.com/lantrix/prsslist.git
				</pre>
			</li>
			<li>You run the program locally by extracting the download and executing the commands:
				<pre>
					cd prsslist
					perl prsslist.pl option values
				</pre>
			</li>
			<li>You can get a list of options by using the "-h" option. When executing the program, you can exit before it's finished by pressing Ctrl-C.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Using the program</h2>

		<p>After you start the program running, you interact with it by accessing the URL it lists. By default, you need to open the following local URL with your browser:</p>
		<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:6555" title="pRSSlist Program 2.0">http://127.0.0.1:6555</a></p>
		<p>You normally quit by using the "Quit" command in the user interface.</p>
		<p>Only the following files are needed for local execution. All others may be deleted.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>prsslist.pl</li>
			<li>prsslist.pm</li>
			<li>prsslistLicense.pm</li>
		</ul>

		<p>prsslist maintains one or more files locally to save all the feed information. By default, those files are stored in the current directory. The files are named "prefix.feed.name.txt", where "prefix" is "listdata" by default and "name" is a name you give to each feed when you create it (for example, "listdata.feed.dblog.txt"). The *-d string* option can be used to set a different datafile prefix than the default "listdata". The prefix may include path information to use a different directory, e.g., "~/prsslist/data/feeddata".</p>

		<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

		<p>If the program displays an error message when run complaining about a missing module, such as LWP, or LWP::UserAgent, you can get the missing module from CPAN. Most Perl installations include the CPAN.pm module to automate this downloading process. You can "seek further help":http://lmgtfy.com/?q=CPAN.pm+how+to+use to get an idea how to use CPAN.pm. CPAN.pm documentation should be available on your computer by using the command "perldoc CPAN".</p>

		<h2>Uninstall</h2>

		<p>If you want to backup your feed data, save the <em>listdata.*</em> files somewhere else</p>
		<p>Delete the directory created when you extracted the download, or from when you cloned the git repository.</p>
